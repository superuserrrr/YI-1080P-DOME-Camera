# Camera Firmware Repair Instructions

This file provided directly by YITECHNOLOGYES directly repairs the camera firmware. I have successfully tested it with the YI 1080p Home Camera model YYS2016.

## Files Required
1. A file called "one_y21ga.bin"
2. A file called "did.txt"

## Instructions
Follow these steps strictly:

1. Format the SD card in FAT32
2. Transfer the files to the root directory of the SD card (do not change the file names)
3. Insert the SD card into the machine and wait for the update
   - The yellow light will be on briefly during the update process
   - Wait for the device to successfully restart
   - Reboot the machine
4. Wait for the machine to emit a voice message again
5. Reinstall and connect the application

## Notice
After the update:
- Delete the files from the SD card
- Update your machine as needed

We await the results. Thank you!
